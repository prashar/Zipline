---> To Build: 

1. Go to the src folder inside assn1/src/
2. type make - It should succesfully compile. 
3. run by typing ./floader 

---> Requirements:

directory as the executable. 
0.5 View Preferably only in 800 x 600 .. 
1. You may pass the name of the model as an argument to the program like
./floader 478Model/test.model . If nothing is passed, then a default path, i.e.
478Model/TechnologyEnterpriseFacility_Gregor.model is assumed which comes with
this src package. 
2. Built only for OS X 10.5.8 
3. No guarantees it will work on Linux ...
