assn1/src: 

1. main.cpp : implements projection, modelview, and various glut related functions. 

assn1/include: 

1. fileparser.h: Contains the declaration and definition of the fileparser
class. It has 3 main functions: load - initializes the class by reading all
triangle values, texture values, etc., buildModelBuilding - parses the
information stored by load() and creates triangles out of them. Also contains
various getter functions like getNumOfVertices,triangles,etc to preserve
abstraction. 

2. vec.h: Contains primitives declared as 3d or 2d vectors in template format.
This file was deemed usable by Gregor, since it wasn't originally written by me,
but I have made some modifications to it.
